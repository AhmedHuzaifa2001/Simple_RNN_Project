ðŸŽ¬ End-to-End Sentiment Analysis with Simple RNN on IMDb Dataset
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for sentiment analysis using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset. The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their text content.

We also take it a step further by deploying the trained model using Streamlit for an interactive web application, making it accessible via the cloud.
